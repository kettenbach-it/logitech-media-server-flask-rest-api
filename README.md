# REST API for Logitech Media Server built with Python Flask

This software is an adapter between a REST interface
and the JSON-RPC interface of the [Logitech Media Server](https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver)

It can be used to control your Logitech Media Server over a REST compliant API.

## Installation
This service was developed with the aim of running in docker.
It will also work without docker, but docker is the recommended way.

Currently I don't provider a docker image on docker hub, so you
need it to build on your own.
